            <p>Urban gardening is an accessible way to bring nature into city living while promoting sustainability and food security. Whether you have a small balcony, windowsill, or rooftop space, you can create a productive garden that benefits both you and your community.</p>

                <h3 id="space-assessment">Assessing Your Space</h3>
                <p>Before selecting plants, evaluate your available growing space. Consider factors such as sunlight exposure, wind patterns, and available square footage. Most vegetables require at least six hours of direct sunlight daily, while herbs and leafy greens can thrive with four to six hours.</p>
                
                <h4>Essential Space Considerations</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Daily sunlight hours and patterns</li>
                    <li>Access to water sources</li>
                    <li>Weight limitations for balconies and rooftops</li>
                    <li>Protection from harsh weather conditions</li>

                <h3 id="container-basics">Container Gardening Basics</h3>
                <p>Container gardening is the foundation of most urban growing systems. Choose containers with adequate drainage holes and appropriate depth for your selected plants. Root vegetables like carrots need deeper containers, while lettuce and herbs can thrive in shallower options.</p>
                
                <h4>Container Selection Guidelines</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Ensure proper drainage to prevent root rot</li>
                    <li>Select appropriate size based on plant mature size</li>
                    <li>Consider material durability and weather resistance</li>
                    <li>Plan for seasonal plant rotation and container reuse</li>
                </ol>
